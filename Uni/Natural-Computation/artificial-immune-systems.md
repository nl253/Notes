# Artificial Immune Systems

## Introduction

Two primary tasks of the immune system: the detection and elimination of
pathogen.

This behavior is typically referred to as the differentiation of self
(molecules and cells that belong to the host organisms) from potentially
harmful non-self.

The architecture of the immune system is such that a series of defensive
layers protect the host. Once a pathogen makes it inside the host, it
must contend with the **innate** and **acquired** immune system.

### Adaptive immunity

-   creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific
    pathogen
-   leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that
    pathogen
-   This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
-   Unlike the innate immune system, the acquired immune system is
    present only in vertebrates (animals with a spinal column)

### Primary and Secondary Immune Response

The first or **primary response** occurs when the system encounters a
novel pathogen. The system is slow to respond, potentially taking a
number of weeks to clear the infection.

On re-encountering the same pathogen again, the system exhibits a
**secondary response**, applying what was learned in the primary
response and clearing up the infection rapidly.

The memory the system acquires in the primary response is typically long
lasting, providing pathogenic immunity for the lifetime of the host, two
common examples of which are the chickenpox and measles.

## Negative Selection

-   inspired by the self-nonself discrimination behavior observed in the
    mammalian acquired immune system
-   accounts for the adaptive behavior of the immune system including
    the ongoing selection and proliferation of cells that select-for
    potentially harmful (and typically foreign) material in the body.
-   responsible for managing a population of immune cells that do not
    select-for the tissues of the body i.e.Â it does not create
    self-reactive immune cells known as **auto-immunity**
-   selects-for and removes those cells that are self-reactive during
    cell creation and cell proliferation
-   Detectors can be prepared with no prior knowledge of the problem
    domain other than the known (normal or self) dataset.

## Positive Selection

## Clonal Selection

-   when a cell is selected and proliferates, it is subjected to small
    copying errors that change the shape of the expressed receptors and
    subsequent determinant recognition capabilities of both the
    antibodies bound to the lymphocytes cells surface, and the
    antibodies that plasma cells produce
-   when a lymphocyte is selected and binds to an antigenic determinant,
    the cell proliferates making many thousands more copies of itself

## Measuring Affinity

-   hamming distance
-   euclidean distance
-   Manhattan block distance

## Glossary

Affinity
:   the degree to which a substance tends to combine with another.

Lymphocytes
:   White blood cells called lymphocytes (or leukocytes) are the most
    important cell in the acquired immune system.

Antibody
:   An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large,
    Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the
    immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria
    and viruses.

Pathogen
:   a bacterium, virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease.

Antigen
:   Antigen is a toxin or other foreign substance that induces an immune
    response in the body, especially the production of antibodies.
