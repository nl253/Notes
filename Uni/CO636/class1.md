# Class 1 

## Question 2.1

### a)

Raising $\bar{g_e}$ to $0.5$:

- raises $act$ (activation) 
- raises $net$ (charge)
- raises $V_m$ (membrane potential)

Lowering $\bar{g_e}$ to $0.3$:

- lowers $net$ (charge)
- lowers $V_m$ (membrane potential)

### b)

Lowering $\bar{g_e}$ to $0.3$ has no effect on $act$ (activation).
Raising $\bar{g_e}$ to $0.5$ raises $act$ (activation).

### c)

It reveleals that the threshold for the activation function is $0.4$. I.e. it
will produce a response only if $net >= 0.4$.

## Question 2.2

The threshold is $0.374$.

## Question 2.3

The higher $\bar{g_l}$ the lower the activation.
