## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

**Cons**:

-   affected by outliers

### Mode

## Measures of Dispersion

### Range

**Cons**:

-   affected by outliers

### Standard Deviation

A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close
to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high
standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a
wider range of values.

In science, many researchers report the standard deviation of
experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two
standard deviations away from what would have been expected are
considered statistically significant -- normal random error or variation
in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine
effects or associations.

**Pros**:

-   *not* affected by outliers

## Distributions
