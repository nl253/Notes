# Geometry

## Euclidean Geometry

For more than two thousand years, the adjective "Euclidean" was
unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived.

Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved
from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense.

Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are
known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century.
An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that
physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good
approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength
of the gravitational field).

## Euclidean space

Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional **Euclidean plane**, the
three-dimensional space of **Euclidean geometry**,

While Euclidean space is defined by a set of axioms, these axioms do not
specify how the points are to be represented.

It's common to define Euclidean space using **Cartesian coordinates**.
It means that points of the space are specified with collections of
**real numbers**, and geometric shapes are defined as equations and
inequalities.

In this case, the Euclidean space is then modeled by **the real
coordinate space** ($R^n$) of the same dimension.

-   In one dimension, this is **the real line**
-   In two dimensions, it is **the Cartesian plane**
-   In higher dimensions it is a coordinate space with three or more
    real number coordinates

Mathematicians denote the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space by $E^n$ if
they wish to emphasize its Euclidean nature, but $R^n$ is used as well
since the latter is assumed to have the standard Euclidean structure,
and these two structures are not always distinguished. Euclidean spaces
have finite dimension.

## Motions on the Plane

There are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the
plane.

One is **translation**, which means a shifting of the plane so that
every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance.

The other is **rotation** about a fixed point in the plane, in which
every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same
angle.

One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures
(usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered
equivalent (**congruent**) if one can be transformed into the other by
some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections

## Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance between two points of the plane with Cartesian
coordinates $(x_1,\ y_1)$ and $(x_2,\ y_2)$ is
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. This is the Cartesian
version of Pythagoras's theorem. In three-dimensional space, the
distance between points $(x_1,\ y_1,\ z_1)$ and $(x_2,\ y_2,\ z_2)$ is
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$, which can be
obtained by two consecutive applications of **Pythagoras' theorem**.

## Notations and Conventions

The Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in parentheses
and separated by commas, as in $(10,\ 5)$ or $(3,\ 5,\ 7)$. The origin
is often labelled with the capital letter $O$. In analytic geometry,
unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters
$(x,\ y)$ in the plane, and $(x,\ y,\ z)$ in three-dimensional space.

In mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the
first coordinate is measured along a horizontal axis, oriented from left
to right. The second coordinate is then measured along a vertical axis,
usually oriented from bottom to top.

### 3D Plane

Two distinct points always determine a (straight) line. Three distinct
points are either **collinear** or determine a unique plane. Four
distinct points can either be **collinear**, **coplanar** or determine
the entire space.

Two distinct lines can either **intersect**, be **parallel** or be
**skew**. Two parallel lines, or two intersecting lines, lie in a unique
plane, so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a
common plane.

Two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel (do
not meet). Three distinct planes, no pair of which are parallel, can
either meet in a common line, meet in a unique common point or have no
point in common. In the last case, the three lines of intersection of
each pair of planes are mutually parallel.

A line can lie in a given plane, intersect that plane in a unique point
or be parallel to the plane. In the last case, there will be lines in
the plane that are parallel to the given line.

A **hyperplane** is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension
of the full space. The hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the
two-dimensional subspaces, that is, the planes. In terms of Cartesian
coordinates, the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear
equation, so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations.

A line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations, each
representing a plane having this line as a common intersection.

### Quadrants

The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into
four infinite regions, called quadrants, each bounded by two half-axes.
These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals:
I (where the signs of the two coordinates are I $(+,+)$, II $(−,+)$, III
$(−,−)$, and IV $(+,−)$. When the axes are drawn according to the
mathematical custom, the numbering goes counter-clockwise starting from
the upper right ("north-east") quadrant.
