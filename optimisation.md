# Optimisation

## Strategy

- maximise gain by investing time, effort and money until the rate at which gain increases plateaus
  - think 80/20 principle
- planning & organisation
  - [x] keep track of things to do
    - [x] minimise data redundancy
    - minimise the number of sources to check:
      - GMail & Uni Mail -- use phone to check both quicker
      - Google Keep (notes especially those that need to be shared with others)
      - Google Calendar
        - events -- have a fixed starting time
        - reminders -- things that need to be done but don't have a fixed starting time
  - [x] timetabling
    - [x] arrangement of activities
    - [x] amount of time spent on some activities in a given period
    - [x] amount of time being engaged in a single activity in a row
    - [x] consistency (eat, sleep and nap around the same time)
    - [x] have as much reoccurring activities fixed in your timetable since it removed
      the need for scheduling them
    - [x] simultaneously, leave some room to optimise activities that aren't fixed by
      rearranging their order
- usage of time *during* activities
  - engagement & focus
    - active learning rather than passive listening
    - deep processing rather than route learning -- see [levels-of-processing model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Levels-of-processing_effect)
      - links between concepts
    - challenge and novelty rather than repetition of the same material
    - develop interest
      - research
  - arousal
    - [ ] naps
      - 20-40 min
      - make it dark
      - 1pm to 3pm
    - [ ] stimulants *if* needed (too much will cause anxiety)
      - coffee
      - music
    - [x] nutrition
      - protein / carbs / fats ratio
    - [x] sleep
      - amount of sleep (min: 8h)
      - starting hour (8pm to 12pm)
