## Glossary

Regression

:

Label

:   when training, labels are the expected output

Feature

:   when training, features are what gets fed into the model

Supervised Learning

:   examples in the form of labelled data are provided to the model

Unsupervised Learning

:   The algorithm finds patterns in the data without being explicitly
    told what to look for. This is unlike supervised learning in which
    for example categories to which inputs are assigned are specified
    upfront

Model

:   -   the thing that's doing the predicting
    -   it's what we are trying to create though the process of learning
        from data
    -   defines the relationship between the features and the label

Classification

:   assigning putting
