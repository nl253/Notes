# CO519, NFA to DFA

For the following NFA, perform various tasks: compute the ε-closures of
(i) state 2, (ii) state 10, (iii) state set {3,7} eliminate the
ε-transitions of this NFA (omit states that become unreachable)
   
This NFA has no ε-transitions, but its character transitions are
non-deterministic. Give four words which are in the language of this NFA
(alphabet {0,1}), and four which are not. List all the sources of
non-determinism of this NFA (state+character). Translate the NFA into
its corresponding DFA.
