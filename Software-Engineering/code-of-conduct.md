# BCS

As a professional body the British Computer Society (known as BCS, the
Chartered Institute for IT), has a responsibility to set rules and professional
standards to direct the behaviour of its members in professional matters.

| It is expected that these rules and professional standards will be higher than
| those established by the general law and that they will be enforced through
| disciplinary action which can result in expulsion from membership. Members are
| expected to exercise their own [judgement](#professional-judgement)(which
| should be made in such a way as to be reasonably justified) to meet the
requirements of the code and seek advice if in doubt.

## Breaches of the Code of Conduct

If a member of BCS should know of, or become aware of, any breach of this Code
of Conduct by another member they are under an obligation to notify BCS
immediately. Breaches of the Code of Conduct may also be brought to the
attention of BCS by others who are not members of BCS. Any breach of the Code
of Conduct brought to the attention of BCS, or of which BCS becomes aware, will
be considered under the Institute's Disciplinary procedures.

Where BCS receives information that a member has been convicted of a criminal
offence, the member, when asked will provide a Standard Disclosure Certificate,
or Certificate of Conviction or other similar notice providing evidence of
their criminal record (if any) within 28 days.

Note that not all convictions are seen as relevant to membership in BCS and
each case will be considered individually.

This Code of Conduct:

-   sets out the professional standards required by BCS as a condition of
    membership.
-   applies to all members, irrespective of their membership grade, the role
    they fulfil, or the jurisdiction where they are employed or discharge their
    contractual obligations.
