# Software Engineering

Software Engineering is concerned with best practices that aim at producing
high quality, reliable, maintainable software.

Not just about coding but also:

-   project management e.g. planning
-   documentation
-   development tools

## Software Costs

-   60% development
-   40% testing

Software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. For systems with a
long life, maintenance costs may be several times development costs.

It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and
techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it
was a personal programming project.

For most types of system, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the
software after it has gone into use.

**Failure to use software engineering methods**:

-   It is fairly easy to write computer programs without using software
    engineering methods and techniques.
-   Many companies have drifted into software development as their products and
    services have evolved. They do not use software engineering methods in
    their everyday work. Consequently, their software is often more expensive
    and less reliable than it should be.

**Increasing system complexity**:

As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex
systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and delivered more
quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have
new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible.

**Computer Science (CS) vs SE**:

CS focuses more on the fundamentals and theory.

## Software Activities

**Attributes of Good Software**:

-   Maintainability
-   Efficiency
-   Acceptability
-   Dependability and Security

**Key Challanges is Software Development**:

-   maintaining QA standards
-   delivering on time
-   delivering within budget
-   diversity of platforms that the software is required to run on
-   business and social changes
-   security -- e.g. data protection
-   scaling

**Activities**:

-   specification (planning)
    -   customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and
        the constraints on its operation
-   development (coding)
    -   the software is designed and programmed.
-   validation (Quality Assurance (QA) practices)
    -   Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is
        what the customer requires.
-   evolution
    -   the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market
        requirements

**SE Methods and Techniques**:

There are many different [types of software system](#types-of-software-systems)
and there is no universal set of software techniques that is applicable to all
of these.

The software engineering methods and tools used depend on:

-   the type of application being developed
-   the requirements of the customer
-   background of the development team

## Types of Software Systems

-   Standalone
    -   run on a local computer
    -   include all the necessary functionality
    -   do not need to be connected to a network
-   Batch processing systems
    -   business systems that are designed to process data in large batches
    -   process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding
        outputs
-   Entertainment systems
    -   primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user
-   Systems for modelling and simulation
    -   developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or
        situations, which include many, separate, interacting objects
-   Data collection systems
    -   collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send
        that data to other systems for processing
-   Systems of systems
    -   These are systems that are composed of a number of other software
        systems

**Types of Software Products**:

-   generic -- stand-alone, sold to any customer e.g. operating system
-   customized -- specialised for specific markets e.g. software for dentists

Some fundamental principles apply to all types of software system, irrespective
of the development techniques used. Systems should be developed using a managed
and understood development process. Of course, different processes are used for
different types of software. Dependability and performance are important for
all types of system. Understanding and managing the software specification and
requirements (what the software should do) are important.

## Software Reuse

-   where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been
    developed rather than write new software
-   dominant approach for constructing web-based systems
-   when building these systems, you think about how you can assemble them from
    pre-existing software components and systems

## Web-based Systems

Web-based systems are complex **distributed systems** but the fundamental
principles of software engineering are as applicable to them as they are to any
other types of system.

Web-based systems should be developed and delivered incrementally. It is now
generally recognized that it is impractical to specify all the requirements for
such systems in advance.
