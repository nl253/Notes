# Project Management

Many software systems will need to be bespoke.

## Risk Management

The aim of project management is to make sure that the outcome of the project
is a product that the client will be satisfied with and to make sure it's
delivered on time and within budget.

Risk management aims to assess, anticipate and deal with risks.

**Types of failures**:

-   human
-   organisational
-   hardware
-   software

Project risk: management

-   operational, organisational and contractual
-   resources (including people), funding and suppliers

Process risk: management and technical

-   planning, staffing, QA, configuration management
-   requirements analysis, design, code and test.

Product risk: technical

-   performance, stability, complexity, acceptance.

Business risk: competition

**Who's risk are they?**

-   Client risks: everything not stated explicitly in the contract
-   Software Developers risks: anything that endangers successful project
    completion

### Measuring Risk Exposure

$$ 
    Exposure = Prob(event)\ *\ Loss(event) 
$$

Issues:

-   measuring risk objectively
-   How do you properly estimate probability and loss?

## Project Planning

1.  Project goals and success factors
    -   negotiated with the customer and other stakeholders
    -   needs to be documented
    -   What's the aim or goal of the project?
    -   What goals or objectives are needed to support that aim?
    -   features and functionality -- we need a **Software Requirement
        Specification**
    -   How will you and the customer be able to assess whether the project has
        worked?
    -   every goal and objective should have critical success factors
    -   **acceptance testing specifications** are used to show that the system
        does what is was expected of it
2.  Scope and assumptions
    -   what's included and what's not included
    -   set boundaries
    -   identify assumptions -- staffing, 3rd party suppliers, technical
        issues, what might be implicit
3.  Tasks and targets
    -   level of detail needs to be right i.e. not too detailed and not too
        minimalistic
    -   targets and milestones should be dated
    -   a good schedule
        -   when tasks start
        -   how much resources is needed
        -   how long it will take
        -   dependent tasks
        -   related milestones
    -   realistic breakdown of tasks
        -   estimation of time and cost
        -   planning resources
        -   monitoring progress
    -   e.g. Gantt chart
4.  Roles and responsibilities
    -   who will do what
    -   allocate responsibilities
    -   e.g. project manager, lead software developer, development team members
5.  Quality plan
    -   how will you assure the quality of your project?
6.  Documentation
    -   customer correspondence
    -   internal communication
    -   agreed specification
    -   issues log
    -   activity log
    -   AFTER: technical documentation
    -   AFTER: user manual
7.  Project control and reporting
    -   regular progress reports to the customer
8.  Stakeholder analysis
    -   who they are
    -   responsibility
    -   perceived attitudes and risks
    -   potential impact on the project
    -   what the project is expected to provide for the stakeholder
9.  Risk analysis
    -   condition
    -   cause
    -   consequence
    -   likelihood
    -   who's responsible for monitoring
    -   what can be done to reduce risk
    -   what can be done if it does happen

## Glossary

Non-Risk
:   It's bound to happen and is no longer considered a risk -- it's a problem.

Risk
:   Possibility of suffering loss. It's not bad itself as it can lead to gain.

Loss

:   negative impact on the project:

    -   product is of lower quality
    -   costs are higher
    -   delivery is later

Avoid

:   -   Don't do the risky bit of the projects.
    -   You end up losing the potential benefits i.e. money.

Contain

:   -   You will have to deal with the problem if it comes.
    -   You commit extra time and money for dealing with the risk.
    -   Unlike 'mitigate' this doesn't mean extra actions in advance. However,
        you do freeze a part of your budget initially and loose it if the event
        happens.
    -   Unlike in 'mitigate', no money is spent up-front (merely temporarily
        frozen) so it's possible that you won't loose any money at all if you
        are lucky and the event never takes place.

Evade

:   -   You know about the possibility of risk but don't do anything to prevent
        the risk.
    -   This may potentially save you money since you aren't spending anything
        on mitigating it, nor are you freezing money to deal with it in case it
        comes.
    -   It might be expensive if the event does occur.

Mitigate

:   -   Doing something in advance.
    -   You are anticipating the problem and you are taking measures to deal
        with it.
    -   This entails costs up-front.

Software Development Failure

:   -   doesn't meet requirements
    -   over-time
    -   over-priced
