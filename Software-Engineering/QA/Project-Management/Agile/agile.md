# Agile and Scrum

Agile software development describes an approach to software development under
which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of
self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s) or end
user(s).

It advocates:

-   adaptive planning
-   evolutionary development
-   early delivery
-   continual improvement

It encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

While there is significant anecdotal evidence that adopting agile practices and
values improves the agility of software professionals, teams and organizations;
some empirical studies have found no scientific evidence.

## Agile Manifesto

The term agile (sometimes written Agile) was popularized, in this context, by
the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Summary:

1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.  Responding to change over following a plan

The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and
underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and
Kanban.

## The team

Three important things in scrum are the product owner, scrum master and team.

-   **Product Owner** specifies the various features of software, the release
    date and priorities.
-   **The scrum master** makes sure that the team is functioning properly,
    productively and enables cooperation across all roles and functionality.
-   development team

## Ceremonies

In addition, Scrum has a set of ceremonies associated with it. They include:

1.  the sprint planning meeting
    -   meeting is between the customer and the team
2.  daily Scrum Meeting
    -   a fifteen minute session initiated by the scrum master
    -   the meeting reviews the work that is done regarding development
3.  sprint review meeting
    -   meeting held with the customer to discuss the code developed over the
        last sprint or release cycle
    -   all the stakeholders involved with the product can participate in the
        meeting and provide inputs for the next sprint

## Artifacts

-   An artefact called **the Product Backlog** prepared by the product owner
    has a list of features of the product including functionality and technical
    architecture.
-   **Burn down Chart** records the activities involved in the sprints
-   **The sprint Backlog** is a subset of the product backlog.

## Sprints

The sprints or iterations are around 30 days in length. A sprint begins with
creating a Sprint Backlog.

## Incremental Delivery

Agile is based on incremental delivery. Break down development process into
increments. The client is strongly involved. They are the one providing
feedback after each increment.
