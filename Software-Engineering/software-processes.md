# Software Processes

A structured set of activities required to develop a software system.

Many different software processes but all involve:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Stage                     Description
  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Specification             defining what the system should do

  Design and implementation defining the organization of the system and
                            implementing the system

  Validation                checking that it does what the customer wants

  Evolution                 changing the system in response to changing customer
                            needs.

A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It
presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.

## Software process models

### Plan Driven vs Agile

Plan driven is when everyone is planned first and then you follow the plan.

-   plan driven doesn't respond well to change
-   plan driven makes it easier to track and measure the progress
-   agile tries to be more flexible
-   in agile plans are done on the go
-   in agile the process is not visible -- it's harder to keep track of what
    has been done

### Waterfall

Separate phases:

-   Requirements analysis and definition
-   System and software design
-   Implementation and unit testing
-   Integration and system testing
-   Operation and maintenance

### Incremental

### Agile

## Prototyping

## Design

## Reuse-Oriented Software Engineering
