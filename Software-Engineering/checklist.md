### Use Case Diagrams

- include
- extend

### Class Diagrams

- what are:
    - attributes
    - features
    - operations
    - stereotypes
    - multiplicities
    - visibility
    - instantiation
    - associations
        - dependencies
            - call
            - instantiate
            - use
            - create
    - interfaces
    - abstract classes
- aggregation vs composition

### Sequence Diagrams

- difference between synchronous and asynchronous messages, what's the syntax
- what's: a lifeline, an activation
- what's `opt`, `alt`, `loop`?

### Activity Diagrams

- what is:
    - fork
    - join
    - merge node
    - decision node
    - swim-lane
- syntax for conditions
- syntax for concurrency
- difference between state, sequence and activity diagrams

### State Diagrams

- what are state diagrams used for
- what is:
    - pseudo-state
    - sub-state

## Software Testing

-   What is "QA"? How does it relate to software testing?
-   Levels of testing, differences and relationships between them (unit, component, integration, system)
-   Discuss the choice of Inputs for unit tests (random, equivalence partition testing, boundary value analysis).
-   Explain the difference between an error, a fault and a failure.
-   Give 6 main desirable characteristics of a software system.
-   What are the goals of testing.
-   Compare and contrast "defect" and "validation testing".
-   Compare and contrast "static" and "dynamic verification".
-   What are the difference between formal methods of testing and other methods
    of testing. Give strengths and weaknesses of both.
-   Discuss deriving tests from specification. How do use cases fit with this?
-   Code coverage (line, function, statement, decision, path, branch -- explanation and difference between them)
-   What is "cyclomatic complexity"?
-   What are "Test doubles" (e.g. mocks, stubs and drivers)?
-   What is "dependency injection"?
-   Discuss the different methods of integration testing (top-down, bottom-up, sandwich).
-   Compare and contrast "white-box" and "black-box testing".
-   Compare and contrast "functional" and "non-functional testing".
-   What is "V & V"? How does it fit with QA?
-   What is "acceptance testing"?
-   What is "regression testing"?
-   What is "TDD"?
-   What is "MC/DC"?

## Professional Issues

### UK Law

- difference between common and criminal law
- barrister vs lawyer vs solicitor

### Organisations

- what professional organisations are relevant to Software Engineering
- BCS
- IET
- IEEE

### Data Protection Act

-   sensitive data such as beliefs, gender, race etc.
-   protects the data of the people who the data is about
-   mostly about personal data i.e. about an individual
-   relates to processing i.e.

### Computer Misuse Act

-   unauthorised access
-   unauthorised access with an intent of committing further offences or
    facilitating committing offences
-   unauthorised modification of computer material

### Patents 

- how do they work

Needs to be non-obvious, inventive, applicable to the industry you are
targeting. Some things cannot be patentable: scientific, mathematical or
software.

- How long do patents last?

Patents last 20 years. But after 18 the details of the contract become publicly
available.

It's more difficult to get patents rights in the UK compared to the US where
it's more liberal. Patents in the UK are more technical.

### Copyright

- What is Copyright?

It means you have the right to express your idea (e.g. music or film) without
anyone unauthorised selling or reproducing it. In the UK you get it
automatically.
